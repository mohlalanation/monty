Monty This is a Monty bytecode interpreter for ALX created by mohlalanation

COMPILATION To compile the Monty interpreter you have to do it as follows:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty

USAGE To use the interpreter you have to call it as follows:

./monty [BYTECODE_FILE]

OPTIONS The current instructions the interpreter handles are the following:

push - pushes an integer to the stack. Usage: push [integer] pall - prints the stack completely. Usage: pall pint - prints the top element of the stack. Usage: pint pop - deletes the top element of the stack. Usage: pop swap - swaps the first two elements. Usage: swap nop - does nothing. Usage: nop add - adds the first two elements and merges them. Usage: add sub - subtracts the first element from the second. Usage: sub mul - multiplies the first two elements. Usage: mul div - divides the second element by the first. Usage: div mod - returns the remainder of div. Usage: mod

DESCRIPTION Monty is a language that is written in bytecode. The monty bytecode contains exactly one instruction per line; if more than one instruction is given in a line, the other instructions will be ignored. It can contain whitespaces in the lines and even empty lines that the interpreter ignores. The bytecode can be commented by using the hash (#) sign. The standard is for the bytecode to be written in a .m file; however, other extentions can also be passed to the interpreter.

If the interpreter encounters any sort of error it will display it along with the line number that the error was found in.
